\section{ Who have the same name (last_name) as the managers of the “Finance” department? }
Analizing the query:
\\
\begin{itemize}
First, get the managers of the “Finance” department
\begin{lstlisting}
	\item SQL Command
	SELECT emp_no From `dept_manager` 
	JOIN `departments` ON dept_manager.dept_no = departments.dept_no 
	WHERE departments.dept_name = "Finance";
\end{lstlisting}
Next, get the last name of these managers
\begin{lstlisting}
	\item SQL Command
	SELECT last_name FROM `employees` 
	WHERE employees.emp_no 
	IN (
		SELECT emp_no From `dept_manager` 
		JOIN `departments` ON dept_manager.dept_no = departments.dept_no 
		WHERE departments.dept_name = "Finance"
	);
\end{lstlisting}
Finally, find who has the same last name with last name of these managers
\begin{lstlisting}
	\item SQL Command
	SELECT CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name) AS Fullname
	FROM `employees`
	WHERE employees.`last_name` IN 
	(SELECT last_name
	FROM `employees`
	WHERE employees.emp_no IN 
	(SELECT emp_no From `dept_manager`
	JOIN `departments` ON dept_manager.dept_no = departments.dept_no
	WHERE departments.dept_name = "Finance"));
	
	\item Other command
	SELECT CONCAT(first_name,' ',last_name) AS Fullname 
	FROM `employees` 
	WHERE employees.`last_name` IN 
	(SELECT last_name 
	FROM `employees` JOIN dept_manager ON employees.emp_no = dept_manager.emp_no
	JOIN departments ON departments.dept_no = dept_manager.dept_no
	WHERE departments.dept_name = 'Finance');

\section{ Find the average salary of each department, from highest to lowest. }
\begin{itemize}
To begin with, we find the average salary of each employees.
\begin{lstlisting}
	\item SQL Command
	SELECT employees.emp_no, AVG(salary) AS avg_emp 
	FROM `employees` 
	JOIN `salaries` ON employees.emp_no=salaries.emp_no 
	GROUP BY salaries.emp_no;
\end{lstlisting}
Then, we query the average salary of each department base on the average salary of each employee, from highest to lowest.
\begin{lstlisting}
	\item SQL Command
	SELECT departments.dept_name, AVG (new_table.avg_emp) AS Average_Salary 
	FROM (
		SELECT employees.emp_no AS emp_no_new, AVG(salary) AS avg_emp 
		FROM `employees` 
		JOIN `salaries` ON employees.emp_no=salaries.emp_no 
		GROUP BY salaries.emp_no
	) AS new_table 
	JOIN `dept_emp` ON new_table.emp_no_new = dept_emp.emp_no 
	JOIN `departments` ON departments.dept_no = dept_emp.dept_no 
	GROUP BY departments.dept_no 
	ORDER BY Average_Salary DESC;

	\item Output

\section{ Find the average salary of each type of Engineer, from highest to lowest. }
\begin{itemize}
First, find the average salary of all employees belong to each type of Engineer
\begin{lstlisting}
	\item SQL Command
	SELECT AVG(salary) AS emp_avg_wage, titles.title AS Type_of_Engineer 
	FROM `employees` 
	JOIN `titles` ON employees.emp_no = titles.emp_no
	JOIN `salaries` ON employees.emp_no=salaries.emp_no 
	WHERE titles.title LIKE '%Engineer%' 
	GROUP BY employees.emp_no;
\end{lstlisting}
Next, we calculate the average salary of each type of Engineer, from highest to lowest.
\begin{lstlisting}
	\item SQL Command
	SELECT table_salary.Type_of_Engineer, AVG(table_salary.emp_avg_wage) AS average_type_engineer 
	FROM(
		SELECT AVG(salary) AS emp_avg_wage, titles.title AS Type_of_Engineer 
		FROM `employees` 
		JOIN `titles` ON employees.emp_no = titles.emp_no 
		JOIN `salaries` ON employees.emp_no=salaries.emp_no 
		WHERE titles.title LIKE '%Engineer%' GROUP BY employees.emp_no
	) AS table_salary 
	GROUP BY table_salary.Type_of_Engineer 
	ORDER BY average_type_engineer DESC;

	\item Output
